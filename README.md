# Unofficial Covid Dashboard
After much criticism about the lack of information provided by the university's and demands for more information, I made this site to provide more in-depth information than the current official covid tracker provided by the university. 

This site currently has 4 charts/graphs to show the progression of COVID throughout the semester.
